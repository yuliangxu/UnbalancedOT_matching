# UnbalancedOT_matching

This project provides simulation code for using unbalanced Optimal Transport to do matching. See details in https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04398

analyze_allATO.R runs simulation code for case 1 with 2 dimensional covariate and linear outcome function. 

Users can easily change the case number, dimension, or outcome function by editing ATO.R file

For Simulation II: Comparison  with more recent methods, ATEHonest.R provides the entire code for producing the simulation results in this section.
KOM.R provides the function used for simulation in this section, this code is adapted from https://github.com/CausalML/KOM-SATE
